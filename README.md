Scripts
=======

A collection of really simple scripts that I've written and collected over the
years. They are generally simplistic and simplifies some boring, repetitive tasks
that I often do. So, please do not expect these to work straight out for you - 
although I try to abstract them whenever I have the time, it's quite likely
you'll need modify them to suit your needs.

Tips
----
I usually throw my scripts into /usr/local/bin (Deb/Ubuntu) so that I can call 
the scripts from anywhere.

Feel free to use them and improve on them. If you do improve them, let me know!

Thanks.
