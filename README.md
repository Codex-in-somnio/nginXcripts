nginXcripts
========

Provide `a2ensite`-like scripts and completions.

## Usage

Put `ngensite` and `ngdissite` into `/usr/local/bin` to call them anywhere.

Completion for `ngensite` and `ngdissite` are in `nginx_complete/nginx`. It should be placed under `/etc/bash_completion.d/`.

Run `quick-install.sh` to do the thing above.
